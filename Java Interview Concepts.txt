🧱 1. Encapsulation – "Protecting the data"
Definition:
Encapsulation is about keeping the internal details of a class hidden and only exposing what is necessary. It helps protect the data by using private access modifiers and providing public getters and setters.

Real-life Example:
Think of a capsule – it hides the medicine inside and only shows the outer shell.

Java Example:

java
Copy
Edit
public class Student {
    private String name; // private variable - not accessible directly

    // Public getter
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Public setter
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
Key Benefits:

Controls how data is accessed/modified.

Increases security.

🧬 2. Inheritance – "Reusing code"
Definition:
Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent).

Real-life Example:
A Dog is a type of Animal. All dogs are animals, so they inherit animal behaviors.

Java Example:

java
Copy
Edit
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

// Usage
Dog d = new Dog();
d.eat(); // from Animal
d.bark(); // from Dog
Key Benefits:

Promotes code reuse.

Easy to manage and extend code.

🌀 3. Polymorphism – "One action, many forms"
Definition:
Polymorphism allows the same method or function to behave differently based on the object calling it.

Types:

Compile-time (Method Overloading)

Run-time (Method Overriding)

Real-life Example:
The word “run” means different things depending on the context: a person can run, a machine can run, or a program can run.

Java Examples:

1. Method Overloading (Compile-time):

java
Copy
Edit
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
2. Method Overriding (Run-time):

java
Copy
Edit
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

Animal obj = new Dog();
obj.sound(); // Output: Bark
Key Benefits:

Improves code flexibility.

Supports dynamic behavior.

🧩 4. Abstraction – "Showing only the essential"
Definition:
Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the important features.

Real-life Example:
When you drive a car, you only need to use the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake – you don’t need to know how the engine works.

Java Example using abstract class:

java
Copy
Edit
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}
Java Example using Interface:

java
Copy
Edit
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting");
    }
}
Key Benefits:

Reduces complexity.

Increases security by hiding details.

Summary Table:
Concept	                 What it means	                           Example
Encapsulation	 Hiding data using getters/setters	      Student with private name
Inheritance	       properties from parent class	         Dog inherits from Animal
Polymorphism	        Many forms of the same method	  draw() for Circle, Square
Abstraction	          Hiding internal details	          Interface or abstract class

Method Overriding
✅ What is it?
Method Overriding means:

A child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

Method name, return type, and parameters must be the same.

Used for runtime polymorphism (deciding which method to run at runtime).

📦 Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
java
Copy
Edit
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();  // Upcasting
        a.sound();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
🔍 Why? The child (Dog) overrides the behavior of sound() from Animal.

🔑 Rules:
Method name and signature must match.

Only allowed when there's inheritance.

Can’t override private, static, or final methods.

➕ Method Overloading
✅ What is it?
Method Overloading means:

Multiple methods in the same class (or inherited) have the same name but different parameters (type, number, or order).

Used for compile-time polymorphism.

📦 Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
java
Copy
Edit
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3));          // Output: 5
        System.out.println(calc.add(2.5, 3.5));      // Output: 6.0
        System.out.println(calc.add(1, 2, 3));       // Output: 6
    }
}
🔍 Why? The add() method is used for different data types or numbers of arguments.

🔑 Rules:
Method name is the same.

Parameter list must be different (by type or number).

Return type can be different, but it's not enough to overload a method.

🧠 Quick Comparison:
Feature	Overloading	Overriding
Where?	Same class or inherited	Subclass (inheritance required)
Parameters	Must be different	Must be the same
Return type	Can be different	Should be same or covariant
Polymorphism type	Compile-time	Runtime
Inheritance needed?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Annotation	❌ Optional	✅ Use @Override for safety

ChatGPT said:
Great! Here are some tricky interview questions on Method Overloading and Method Overriding — designed to test deep understanding and not just definitions.

🔁 Method Overriding – Tricky Questions
❓Q1: Can we override a static method?
Answer: No. Static methods belong to the class, not the object. If you define a static method in the child class with the same signature, it's called method hiding, not overriding.

java
Copy
Edit
class A {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("A");
    }
}
class B extends A {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("B");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A obj = new B();
        obj.show();  // Output: A (not B!)
    }
}
❓Q2: Can we override a private method?
Answer: No. Private methods are not visible to the child class, so they can't be overridden.

❓Q3: Can we override a method and change the return type?
Answer: Yes, if the return type is covariant (i.e., subclass of the original return type).

java
Copy
Edit
class A {
    A get() { return this; }
}
class B extends A {
    @Override
    B get() { return this; }
}
❓Q4: What if we remove @Override but the method looks like overriding?
Answer: The code still works if it’s correctly overriding, but @Override helps catch errors like typo in method name or incorrect signature. Always use it!

➕ Method Overloading – Tricky Questions
❓Q5: Does method overloading depend on the return type?
Answer: No. You can’t overload just by changing the return type.

java
Copy
Edit
int add(int a, int b);
double add(int a, int b); // ❌ Compile-time error
❓Q6: Can constructors be overloaded?
Answer: Yes! Java allows constructor overloading.

java
Copy
Edit
class Student {
    Student() {}
    Student(String name) {}
    Student(String name, int age) {}
}
❓Q7: What happens if method overloading has ambiguity?
java
Copy
Edit
void print(Object o) { System.out.println("Object"); }
void print(String s) { System.out.println("String"); }

print(null);  // Output?
Answer: "String", because String is more specific than Object. If you had print(Integer) and print(String), this would cause ambiguity.

❓Q8: Can we overload main() method?
Answer: Yes, but JVM will only call the standard main(String[] args).

java
Copy
Edit
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main method");
    }

    public static void main(int x) {
        System.out.println("Overloaded main: " + x);
    }
}


 What is Java Collections Framework?
Java Collections is a framework that provides classes and interfaces to store and manipulate groups of objects.

🔑 Why use Collections?
To store multiple elements (like arrays but more flexible)

To perform operations like searching, sorting, inserting, deleting, updating

To choose the best data structure for the task (List, Set, Map, etc.)

              NavigableMap
🔢 1. List – Ordered collection, allows duplicates
🔹 Implementations:
ArrayList: Resizable array (fast for read, slow for insert/delete)

LinkedList: Doubly linked list (fast for insert/delete)

Vector: Synchronized ArrayList (rarely used now)

✅ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
List<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
fruits.add("Apple");
fruits.add("Banana");
fruits.add("Apple");  // duplicates allowed

System.out.println(fruits);  // [Apple, Banana, Apple]
🔁 2. Set – Unordered, no duplicates
🔹 Implementations:
HashSet: Unordered, uses hash table

LinkedHashSet: Maintains insertion order

TreeSet: Sorted set (natural order)

✅ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Set<String> colors = new HashSet<>();
colors.add("Red");
colors.add("Blue");
colors.add("Red");  // Duplicate ignored

System.out.println(colors);  // [Red, Blue] (unordered)
📥 3. Queue – FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
🔹 Implementations:
LinkedList

PriorityQueue: Elements ordered by priority

✅ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Queue<String> tasks = new LinkedList<>();
tasks.add("Task1");
tasks.add("Task2");

System.out.println(tasks.poll());  // Task1
System.out.println(tasks.peek());  // Task2
🗺️ 4. Map – Key-value pairs
🔹 Implementations:
HashMap: No order, allows one null key

LinkedHashMap: Insertion order

TreeMap: Sorted by keys

✅ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Map<Integer, String> students = new HashMap<>();
students.put(1, "Alice");
students.put(2, "Bob");
students.put(1, "Charlie");  // Overwrites key 1

System.out.println(students);  // {1=Charlie, 2=Bob}
🔧 Utility Classes
🔸 Collections (with s) – Provides utility methods
java
Copy
Edit
List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 1, 5);
Collections.sort(nums);  // Sorts the list
System.out.println(nums);  // [1, 2, 4, 5]
🧠 Real-World Analogy
List: Like a queue at a coffee shop (can have duplicates, ordered).

Set: Like a unique guest list – no duplicates allowed.

Map: Like a dictionary – key = word, value = meaning.

Queue: Like a printer queue – first task gets printed first.

ChatGPT said:
Great! Here are the key differences and use-cases for these Java collections in a clear and concise format with examples:

✅ 1. Difference: ArrayList vs LinkedList
Feature	ArrayList	LinkedList
Data Structure	Dynamic array	Doubly linked list
Access time	Fast (O(1)) using index	Slow (O(n)) – must traverse
Insertion/Deletion	Slow (O(n)) – shifts elements	Fast (O(1)) – only pointers updated
Memory	Less memory usage	More (stores next & previous node)
Best For	Frequent reads	Frequent inserts/deletes

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> list2 = new LinkedList<>();
✅ 2. Difference: HashMap vs TreeMap vs LinkedHashMap
Feature	HashMap	TreeMap	LinkedHashMap
Order	No order	Sorted by keys (natural/custom)	Insertion order maintained
Null Keys	1 allowed	Not allowed	1 allowed
Performance	Fastest (O(1) average)	Slower (O(log n)) – Red-Black Tree	Slightly slower than HashMap
Use Case	Lookup without order	Sorted data	Order-sensitive caching, etc.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Map<String, Integer> map1 = new HashMap<>();
Map<String, Integer> map2 = new TreeMap<>();
Map<String, Integer> map3 = new LinkedHashMap<>();
✅ 3. Difference: Set vs List
Feature	Set	List
Duplicates	Not allowed	Allowed
Order	No guaranteed order (unless LinkedHashSet)	Maintains insertion order
Access by Index	Not allowed	Allowed
Best Use	Unique items	Ordered items, duplicates okay

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Set<String> emails = new HashSet<>();
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
✅ 4. When to Use Which Collection?
Use Case	Best Collection	Why?
Need fast random access	ArrayList	Index-based fast retrieval
Need frequent insert/delete in middle	LinkedList	No shifting required
Need unique items without duplicates	HashSet	Ensures uniqueness
Need items in sorted order	TreeSet / TreeMap	Keeps elements/keys sorted
Need key-value pair storage	HashMap	Fast lookup by key
Need insertion order in map	LinkedHashMap	Preserves insertion order
Need sorted key-value storage	TreeMap	Automatically sorted keys
Implementing a cache (with LRU logic)	LinkedHashMap	Supports access order for eviction
Need FIFO behavior	Queue (LinkedList)	Queue-based operations


What is a HashMap?
A HashMap stores key-value pairs, like a dictionary.

java
Copy
Edit
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("name", "John");
map.put("city", "Delhi");
🧠 Internal Concepts Used
Hashing – converts key to an integer (called hash code)

Array + LinkedList/Tree – stores entries in buckets

equals() and hashCode() methods – to compare keys

⚙️ How Does put(key, value) Work?
Step-by-step:
Compute hashCode of the key
Example:
"name".hashCode() → 3373707

Calculate index using this hash
Example:
index = hash % array.length
→ assume array size = 16
index = 3373707 % 16 = 11

Check if anything is already at index 11

If nothing is there, store new Node(key, value)

If something is already there → collision handling happens

💥 What if 2 keys have same index?
This is called a collision. Java handles it in two ways:

1. Before Java 8:
Uses Linked List to store multiple entries at the same index.

java
Copy
Edit
Index 5: [ ("id", 1) ] → ("empId", 101) → ("rollNo", 33)
2. From Java 8 onwards:
If too many collisions at same index (threshold = 8), converts that LinkedList to a Balanced Tree (Red-Black Tree) for faster access.

⚙️ How Does get(key) Work?
Step-by-step:
Compute hashCode of the key

Calculate index: hash % array.length

Go to that index in the bucket array

Iterate through LinkedList or Tree at that index

Compare with .equals() method to find the correct key

🧠 Important Internal Classes:
Node<K, V>: Basic unit stored in HashMap

java
Copy
Edit
static class Node<K,V> implements Map.Entry<K,V> {
    final int hash;
    final K key;
    V value;
    Node<K,V> next; // for collision (linked list)
}
📦 Resizing/Rehashing:
Default size = 16

Load Factor = 0.75 (i.e., 75%)

When 75% full → array size is doubled (resize)

Rehashing: all existing entries are recalculated and placed into the new bigger array

✅ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("apple", 10);
map.put("banana", 20);
map.put("grapes", 30);

System.out.println(map.get("banana")); // Output: 20
🔐 Summary
Term	                     Meaning
Hashing	              Converts key → number
Bucket	             Array index (stores nodes)
Collision	         Two keys end up at same bucket
Load Factor          Resize when 75% full (default 0.75)
Treeify	             LinkedList becomes Tree if too many entries (8+)

What is Exception Handling?
Exception Handling is the mechanism to handle runtime errors (called exceptions) so that normal flow of the program can be maintained without crashing.

Why do we need Exception Handling?
To handle unexpected errors gracefully

To prevent program from abrupt termination

To provide meaningful error messages or recovery options

Types of Errors in Java
Type	Description	Example
Compile-time	Detected by compiler	Syntax errors
Runtime errors	Occur during program execution	Dividing by zero, null pointer

What is an Exception?
An Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It’s an object which represents an error or unusual condition.

Exception Handling Keywords
Keyword	Usage
try	Block of code to monitor for exceptions
catch	Block to handle the exception
finally	Block that executes always (cleanup code)
throw	Used to explicitly throw an exception
throws	Declares exceptions that a method can throw

Syntax:
java
Copy
Edit
try {
    // Code that may throw exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Handle exception here
} finally {
    // Code always executed (optional)
}
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // throws ArithmeticException
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("This will always run.");
        }
    }
}
Output:

Cannot divide by zero!
This will always run.
Multiple catch blocks
You can catch different exceptions separately:

java
Copy
Edit
try {
    // risky code
} catch (NullPointerException e) {
    // handle NPE
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // handle Arithmetic
} catch (Exception e) {
    // handle other exceptions
}
Throwing Exceptions Explicitly
java
Copy
Edit
public void validateAge(int age) throws Exception {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new Exception("Age must be 18 or older.");
    }
}
Callers must handle or declare this exception.

Custom Exceptions
You can create your own exceptions by extending Exception or RuntimeException.

java
Copy
Edit
class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
Best Practices
Always catch specific exceptions before general ones.

Use finally block to close resources like files or DB connections.

Don’t suppress exceptions silently; log or handle them.

Avoid catching Throwable or Error unless necessary.

You said:
yes give me common & tricky interview questions with answers on Exception Handling


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here are common and tricky interview questions on Exception Handling in Java, along with clear, concise answers:

1. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
Answer:

Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, and must be either caught or declared with throws (e.g., IOException).

Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException and checked at runtime; no need to declare or catch (e.g., NullPointerException).

2. What is the difference between throw and throws?
Answer:

throw is used to explicitly throw an exception object in the method body.

throws is used in the method signature to declare that the method may throw certain exceptions.

3. Can a try block be used without a catch block?
Answer:
Yes, if the try block is followed by a finally block, the catch block is optional.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
try {
    // code
} finally {
    // cleanup code
}
4. What happens if an exception is not caught?
Answer:
If an exception is not caught, it propagates up the call stack. If it reaches the main method without being handled, the program terminates and prints the stack trace.

5. What is the purpose of the finally block?
Answer:
The finally block contains code that always executes, whether an exception is thrown or not. It’s typically used to release resources like closing files or database connections.

6. Can you catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block?
Answer:
Yes, since Java 7, you can catch multiple exceptions using the pipe (|) operator.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
catch (IOException | SQLException e) {
    // handle exceptions
}
7. What is the difference between Exception and Error?
Answer:

Exception represents recoverable conditions and can be handled.

Error represents serious problems (like OutOfMemoryError) that are usually not handled by programs.

8. Explain the concept of exception propagation.
Answer:
When an exception occurs, Java looks for a matching catch block in the current method. If not found, it propagates to the caller method, and continues up the stack until caught or program terminates.

9. What is a custom exception and how do you create one?
Answer:
A custom exception is a user-defined exception class created by extending Exception or RuntimeException.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
public class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
10. What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?
Answer:

final: Keyword to declare constants, prevent method overriding or inheritance.

finally: Block that executes after try/catch for cleanup.

finalize(): Method called by garbage collector before object destruction (deprecated since Java 9).

11. Can the finally block suppress exceptions?
Answer:
Yes, if the finally block itself throws an exception, it can suppress the exception thrown in the try or catch block.

12. What is try-with-resources?
Answer:
It’s a try statement that automatically closes resources (like files, streams) when done. Requires resources to implement AutoCloseable.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
    // read file
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle exception
}
// br is auto-closed
13. Is it good practice to catch Exception or Throwable?
Answer:
No, catching Exception or especially Throwable is discouraged because it can catch unchecked exceptions and errors, potentially hiding serious problems.

14. Can you throw multiple exceptions from a method?
Answer:
Yes, declare multiple exceptions using commas:

java
Copy
Edit
public void myMethod() throws IOException, SQLException {
    // method body
}
15. What happens if an exception occurs in both the try and finally blocks?
Answer:
The exception in the finally block will suppress the exception thrown in the try block and propagate instead.

If you want, I can prepare code examples for these or provide explanations on any tricky questions!







You said:
i didnt understand this supress means ? he exception in the finally block will suppress the exception thrown in the try block and propagate instead.


ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let me explain "suppress" in this context in a simple way:

What does it mean that an exception in the finally block suppresses an exception in the try block?
Suppose your try block throws an exception (call it Exception A).

Then, while running the finally block (which always runs after try), another exception is thrown (call it Exception B).

What happens?
The Exception B (from the finally block) will be the one that actually comes out of the method. The Exception A (from the try block) will be ignored or "lost" — it is suppressed by Exception B.

Why is this important?
Because you might expect the first exception (Exception A) to be the one you catch or see, but instead you only see the second one (Exception B).

Example to clarify:
java
Copy
Edit
public void exampleMethod() {
    try {
        System.out.println("In try");
        throw new RuntimeException("Exception from try");
    } finally {
        System.out.println("In finally");
        throw new RuntimeException("Exception from finally");
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    exampleMethod();
}
What will happen?

The try block throws "Exception from try".

Then, the finally block throws "Exception from finally".

The exception that propagates out of exampleMethod is "Exception from finally".

The first exception ("Exception from try") is suppressed — it gets lost.

Summary in simple terms:
Suppress here means one exception hides another.

The exception in the finally block "wins" and the exception from the try block is ignored.

What is Garbage Collection?
Garbage Collection is the automatic process by which Java frees up memory by removing objects that are no longer needed or referenced by the program.

Since Java manages memory automatically, programmers don’t have to manually free memory (unlike languages like C or C++). The Java Garbage Collector helps prevent memory leaks and makes memory management easier.

How does Garbage Collection work?
Objects and Memory
When you create an object using new (like new String(), new MyClass()), Java allocates memory for it on the heap.

Java keeps track of which objects are still reachable—meaning they can be accessed through some chain of references starting from active threads, static variables, or local variables on the stack.

Unreachable Objects
If an object cannot be reached by any reference (no part of your program can use it anymore), it becomes eligible for garbage collection.

GC Process
The Garbage Collector runs periodically or when the JVM detects low available memory and:

Finds all unreachable objects.

Frees the memory allocated to those objects so it can be reused.

When does Garbage Collection run?
You cannot force the Garbage Collector to run exactly at a certain time.

You can suggest it by calling System.gc() or Runtime.getRuntime().gc(), but it's just a request, not a guarantee.

The JVM decides the best time to run GC based on memory usage and other factors.

Types of Garbage Collectors in Java
Java offers multiple GC algorithms to optimize performance:

Serial GC: Simple, stops all application threads during collection. Good for small apps.

Parallel GC: Uses multiple threads for GC, suitable for multi-core processors.

CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep) GC: Attempts to minimize pause times by doing most GC work concurrently with the app.

G1 (Garbage First) GC: Designed for large heaps; divides heap into regions and collects them incrementally.

How Garbage Collection Works Internally — Key Phases
1. Marking
GC identifies all live objects (reachable) by starting from roots like static variables, local variables, active threads.

2. Normal Deletion (Sweep)
Objects not marked as live are deleted, and their memory is reclaimed.

3. Deletion with Compaction
Some GCs compact memory after deletion to reduce fragmentation, moving objects together and updating references.

Generations in Heap
The Java heap is divided into generations for efficient GC:

Young Generation: Where new objects are allocated.

Objects that survive here get promoted.

Old (Tenured) Generation: Where long-lived objects reside.

Permanent Generation / Metaspace: Stores class metadata.

GC is usually more frequent in the Young Generation (called Minor GC) and less frequent but more expensive in the Old Generation (Major GC or Full GC).

Why is Garbage Collection Important?
Prevents memory leaks by cleaning unused objects.

Helps maintain application performance by reclaiming memory.

Makes Java memory management automatic and safe.

Simple Example to Understand GC
java
Copy
Edit
public class GCDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GCDemo obj1 = new GCDemo();
        GCDemo obj2 = new GCDemo();

        obj1 = null;  // obj1 no longer references the first object
        obj2 = null;  // obj2 no longer references the second object

        System.gc();  // Request garbage collection
    }

    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Object is garbage collected");
    }
}
Here, after obj1 and obj2 are set to null, the objects they referenced become eligible for GC.

When GC runs, finalize() may be called before memory is freed (deprecated in modern Java but shows GC action).

Summary:
Concept	Explanation
Garbage Collection (GC)	Automatic memory cleanup for unreachable objects.
Reachable Objects	Objects accessible via references.
Unreachable Objects	Objects not referenced; eligible for GC.
GC Phases	Mark (find live), Sweep (delete unreachable), Compact (optional).
Heap Generations	Young (new objects), Old (long-lived), Metaspace (class info).
GC Types	Serial, Parallel, CMS, G1, etc.
Manual GC Call	System.gc() requests GC but does not force it.


What is Multithreading?
Multithreading means running multiple threads (smallest units of a program) at the same time within a single program.

Each thread can run independently.

Threads share the same process memory but execute separately.

It helps in doing multiple tasks concurrently, making the program faster and more efficient.

Why Use Multithreading?
Better resource utilization: Use CPU efficiently by performing multiple tasks simultaneously.

Improved performance: For CPU-intensive or IO-intensive tasks.

Responsive applications: Like UI apps remain responsive while doing background work.

Examples:

Web servers handling multiple users.

Video games handling rendering, physics, input at once.

Download managers downloading multiple files.

Thread vs Process
Aspect	Process	Thread
Memory	Has its own memory space	Shares memory with other threads in same process
Communication	Complex, uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication)	Simple, can directly access shared data
Creation overhead	Heavy	Light
Execution	Independent	Dependent on parent process

How to Create Threads in Java?
1. By Extending Thread class
java
Copy
Edit
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // start() calls run() internally on a new thread
    }
}
2. By Implementing Runnable interface
java
Copy
Edit
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread running");
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();
    }
}
Key Thread Methods
start() — Starts a new thread and calls run().

run() — Contains code executed by the thread.

sleep(milliseconds) — Pauses thread for specified time.

join() — Waits for a thread to finish before continuing.

yield() — Suggests scheduler to pause current thread and let others run.

Thread Lifecycle
New — Thread object created.

Runnable — Ready to run, waiting for CPU.

Running — Thread executing run() method.

Waiting/Blocked — Thread waiting for resource or time.

Terminated — Thread finished execution or stopped.

Synchronization and Thread Safety
Because threads share memory, they may try to access and modify the same data simultaneously, leading to problems like:

Race conditions — wrong results because of simultaneous access.

Data inconsistency.

Solution: Synchronization
Use the synchronized keyword to make sure only one thread accesses a critical section of code at a time.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
Here, the increment() method can be safely used by multiple threads without corrupting the count.

Deadlock
Deadlock happens when two or more threads wait for each other to release resources, and none can proceed.

Example:

Thread A holds resource 1 and waits for resource 2.

Thread B holds resource 2 and waits for resource 1.

Both are stuck forever.

Thread Communication
Threads can communicate using methods like:

wait() — Makes current thread wait.

notify() — Wakes up one waiting thread.

notifyAll() — Wakes up all waiting threads.

These are used inside synchronized blocks to coordinate work between threads.

Advantages of Multithreading
Faster execution by parallelism.

Better system resource utilization.

Simpler program structure for asynchronous tasks.

Simple Example — Two Threads Printing Numbers
java
Copy
Edit
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for(int i=1; i<=5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " : " + i);
            try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch(Exception e) {}
        }
    }
}

public class MultiThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();

        t1.setName("Thread 1");
        t2.setName("Thread 2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}

Here are some common tricky interview questions on Multithreading with clear answers:

1. What is the difference between start() and run() methods in Java Thread?
Answer:

start() creates a new thread and calls the run() method internally on that new thread.

run() just executes the code on the current thread like a normal method call, does NOT create a new thread.

2. What is the difference between Runnable and Callable interface?
Answer:

Runnable's run() method returns void and cannot throw checked exceptions.

Callable's call() method returns a result (generic type) and can throw checked exceptions.

Callable can be used with Future to get the result asynchronously.

3. What is a race condition? How do you prevent it?
Answer:

Race condition happens when multiple threads access shared data simultaneously and cause inconsistent or incorrect results.

Prevent using synchronization, locks, or other concurrency controls to ensure only one thread accesses critical code at a time.

4. Explain Deadlock and how to avoid it.
Answer:

Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.

Avoid by:

Acquiring locks in a consistent order.

Using timeouts for lock attempts.

Avoiding nested locks if possible.

5. What is the difference between synchronized method and synchronized block?
Answer:

synchronized method locks the entire method for the instance or class (if static).

synchronized block locks only a specific block of code, allowing finer control and better performance.

6. Can a thread hold multiple locks at the same time?
Answer:

Yes, a thread can acquire multiple locks if needed.

But this increases the risk of deadlock if other threads try to acquire these locks in a different order.

7. What is the difference between wait() and sleep()?
Answer:

wait() releases the lock and waits until notified (notify() or notifyAll()), used for thread communication.

sleep() pauses the thread for specified time but does not release the lock.

8. How does volatile keyword work?
Answer:

volatile ensures that a variable's value is always read from main memory, not cached thread-locally.

Guarantees visibility of changes across threads but does not guarantee atomicity.

9. What is Thread Pool? Why use it?
Answer:

Thread Pool manages a fixed number of reusable threads.

It improves performance by reusing existing threads instead of creating new threads every time.

Helps in managing resource consumption efficiently.

10. How does Java handle thread scheduling?
Answer:

Java relies on the underlying OS for thread scheduling.

Threads have priorities (Thread.setPriority()), but scheduling is not guaranteed to strictly follow priorities.

Scheduling is usually preemptive and time-sliced.
